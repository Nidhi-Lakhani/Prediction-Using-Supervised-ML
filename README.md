# Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. The training data is given which is to be used to train the machine learning algorithm, then plot the actual vs predicted values, evaluate the model and visualise the data. 
This is a part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation: Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP) in the Data Science and Business Ananlytics domain.
